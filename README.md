## Reflection

  - I decided to do this project to deepen my understanding of authentication as cybersecurity is particular topic of interest for me.
  - For this app I set out to build an application with a secure registration and login process.
  - The tools I used in this project include:
      - Node.js
      - React.js
      - Express.js
      - MongoDB
      - OAuth2
      - SendGrid for automated emails
